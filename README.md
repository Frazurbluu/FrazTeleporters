Fraz Teleport System (Script Drop In!)

    Feb 3, 2017

    This version is only compatible with the Data files from the previous version!
    If you wish to use v2.0 series you must remove the previous installation from your code if present!
    It is not necessary to update, although the new version has a few benefits over the older version, of course. (See below)

    The 2.0 version and beyond will only be contained in your Scripts folder.
    Point4D v1.1 resource required to use the new system.

    New version has the option to use the ServUO csv files and the previous versions custom files, or either or.
    Note: So no data files are needed extra, if you don't wish to use them.

    I've been able to solve the problem I encountered earlier, it's amazing what stepping away from something for a bit can do... :)

    New system uses Dictionaries using 4D points for keys.
    Eliminates using and looping items.
    Eliminates using and looping an array.
    Eliminates everything negative about having unwanted items laying around.

    Plus all the nifty sound and graphic effects for the custom files, and conditionals for more precise control.

    Added a player level command [TeleGlow (can be changed to Admin w/e)
    causing all teleporters to glow in the mobiles update range when the command is used,
    for a limited time..
    Blue = Active / Red = Inactive (Can be updated for more later)
